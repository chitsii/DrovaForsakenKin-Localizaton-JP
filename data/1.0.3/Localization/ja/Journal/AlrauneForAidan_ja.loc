Title { The Power of Potions }

Entry_01 { Aidan is conducting potion experiments at the remnants' camp. He wishes to concoct a powerful strength potion. For that, he needs a rare Basalt Root, which apparently grows in caves. If I bring him this root, he will brew a potion for meâ€”though he himself is unsure if it will work. }

Entry_02 { The potion was a success. }
