Entry_01 { Rura wants me to take Muc to her. He's supposed to help with the work. Rura said that he actually wanted to go to Georgefarm. But it's also possible that he's already finished there and is perhaps lazing around in the apple grove east of Nemeton. I should have a look around. }

Entry_02 { I found Muc and sent him to Rura. }

Entry_04 { Rura was really relieved when Muc arrived. Finally, he can assist her with work. Now she's going to teach me something about blacksmithing. }
